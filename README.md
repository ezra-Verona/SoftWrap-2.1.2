Softwrap 2.1.2 â€“ Blender 4.4 Fix
This is a patched version of the Softwrap 2.1.2 add-on, originally developed by Jean Da Costa Machado, then modified by /danemadsen to work with 3.1 , further modified by me to work with 4.4

The original version didnâ€™t work out-of-the-box with Blender 4.4, so I modified it until it did. I'm not an expert â€” just someone who wanted it working â€” so take this as a "working" patch.

âœ… Whatâ€™s Changed
Updated the add-on to work with Blender 4.4 and Python 3.11.
Recompiled the Cython core module softwrap_core2.pyd using the correct Python version and compiler setup.
Cleaned up the file structure to keep it minimal but developer-friendly.

ðŸ›  Developer Info
If you want to modify or recompile the core, the core/ folder includes:
core2.pyx â€“ the Cython source
setup.py â€“ the build script
Youâ€™ll need Python 3.11.x, Cython, and Visual Studio Build Tools to rebuild.

ðŸ§  If Something Breaks
If you run into issues:
Make sure you're using the correct Python version (3.11, not 3.13 or 3.10).
If it's a weird error and you're not sure how to fix it â€” ask ChatGPT. Thatâ€™s how I got this working in the first place.
